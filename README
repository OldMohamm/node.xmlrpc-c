XML-RPC Client for node.js

This module is based (and depends) on the libxml.js library that you 
can find here http://libxmljs.squishtech.com/

Once you have compiled it, move the libxmljs.node file where the xmlrpc-c.js module is

This library is still too young and not complete and should NOT be used in production. 

Here are (some of) the limitations:

- Only "string" and "integer" are supported as input parameter type
- Data conformance checks are VERY lousy!
- "double" is not yet supported as output parameter
- no tests at all
